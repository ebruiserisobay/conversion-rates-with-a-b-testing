Business Problem\n","\n","Facebook recently introduced a new type of bid called “average bid” as an alternative to the current type of bid called “maximum bid”. An A/B test was conducted to see if the average bid converts more than the maximum bid. The A/B test consists of data collected over a month. The ultimate measure of success is the purchase. Therefore, the test focused on the “purchase” metric.\n","\n","\n","## 2. About Dataset\n","\n","This dataset, which contains a company's website information, includes information such as the number of advertisements seen and clicked by users, as well as information about the earnings from these advertisements. There are two separate data sets: control and test group. These data sets are on separate pages of the file. Maximum bidding was applied to the control group and average bidding was applied to the test group.\n","\n","* **Impression:** Number of ad views\n","* **Click:** Number of clicks on the displayed ad\n","* **Purchase:** Number of products purchased after clicking the ads\n","* **Earning:** Revenue obtained from purchased products"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ce654b33","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00656,"end_time":"2024-06-06T01:58:59.826694","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-06-06T01:58:59.820134","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 3.
